Finsify Aggregator provides Bank Aggregation service with the help of screen scraping technologies. In this blog, we will give you an overview of this technology and how it benefits fintech companies.

## Definition of Screen Scraping

According Wikipedia ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_scraping)), Screen Scraping or Data Scraping is a technique in which a computer program extracts data from human-readable output coming from another program. In other words, it's is a process through which the information is gathered from the Internet and is then later aggregated for some particular use.

Now we will explain the term Screen Scraping in the words that everyone can understand, even an old men who has never used computer before. Think about a public library which has hundred thousands of books. To know what the books are about, their subjects, it actually needed to be read and labeled or categorized. It seem a ton of work with enormous effort.

When applying screen scraping, these a not the books we handle with but the web pages. As data is in digital form, it's possible to perform all processes without any human efforts. Imagine that a robot is able to screen all pages of book at the light speed then places books at the right shelf in the library. You can imagine screen scraping technology is similar. 

## Example of Screen Scraping: Google Search

One of the best examples of screen scraping is Google Search the thing the Internet users like us use everyday. You enter the searching phases and Google shows up the search results within seconds.

According to Google, ([https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/)) Google is using web crawlers to organize information from webpages and other publicly available content in the Search index. Before you search, web crawlers gather information from across hundreds of billions of web pages and organize it in the Search index.

## Data Scraping in Fintech aka Financial Technology

Now this is the most important part of this article. As you know, your financial information including account balance, transaction history, savings or debts is stored and secured by your banks and it mostly could not be accessed publicly.

Is it good or bad? Generally it's good because you would rarely want to share your information to others such as third parties. However, in some circumstances it's better to share your financial information with another secure institution than keeping it in the safe.

Fintech companies leverage screen scraping technology to develop products that better service both individual consumers and corporates.

The most well-known use case is personal finance management solution. Personal financial management (PFM) refers to software that helps users manage their money. PFM often lets users categorize transactions and add accounts from multiple institutions into a single view. PFM also typically includes data visualizations such as spending trends, budgets and net worth. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_financial_management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_financial_management)).

Before, consumers have to handle all tasks manually such as download bank statements, categorize transactions, it's really time-consuming. But thank for screen scraping technology to enable PFM software to process most of tasks automatically. It helps user to download bank statements, categorize transactions, generate reports, advise them based on consumer goals and transaction history and it's totally automatic.

Corporates benefit from screen scraping technology when using automatic accounting services. It helps companies gather a lots of transactions from multiple bank accounts in one place, accounting software in near real-time, 24/7. It means no more manual jobs, no more delay and mistakes.

When you share your information to financial institutions they can analyse your previous performance then supply you more attractive offers such as credit card or loan with reasonable rate. We can say that banks and institution could leverage and adapt data scraping to better understand consumer behaviour and consumption of financial service to offer their customers more suitable products. 

## Advantages of Finsify Screen Scraping technology

Now we have come to a part where I suppose to tell why Finsify Aggregator technology is exactly what you need when it comes to extracting financial data. Let's see how our technology works for you.

### Security

Finisfy Aggregator offers both SaaS and On-Premises solutions to fit the needs of different clients. Both solutions offer a high level of data security:

**No sensitive credentials are ever stored** in database or logged on the server thus virtually eliminating risk of any external attacks on the server running service

**Credentials are stored only in volatile memory** and are deleted as soon as they are no longer needed

**No financial data is persisted to database** unless the user explicitly chooses to do so. However, it needs to be stressed that the data is stored in database only for a predefined period of time (24 hours at most). The API allows the client to delete any stored data, when it becomes obsolete

**Industry standard**: to fetch data Finsify Aggregator service uses **https protocol** to connect to external websites

**Finsify Aggregator service is well protected against man-in-the-middle attacks**. It uses its own trust store containing strictly selected CA certificates that identify other parties the service connects to, during the development phase strong emphasis is placed on security. Every change to the core of the Finisfy Aggregator service is reviewed before going on to production.

Finsify Aggregator provides a dedicated server for every single client. This way you are not only getting enhanced security, but also a higher degree of reliability. Less requests will take place, hence the chances something goes wrong are smaller too. Also, there will be less stress placed on your servers, less bandwidth will be used and you could actually get more imports in the same time!

### Speech

Finsify Aggregator is developed in pure Java, our technology lets us perform the extraction of the data faster and with a higher rate of success.

Speed, of course, is the one of considerable factor when selecting aggregation service beside Security. 

### Flexibility

Another great point of our software is its flexibility. As you can choose among different integration models depending on the needs of your organisation, you can also get financial data aggregation customised to fit the needs of your software or application.

In general, we are simply supplying you with the technology that is exactly like a plain canvas â€“ you are an artist that has to create the app the way you want it using our service.
